# Projets
This document aims to facilitate familiarity with my project portfolio. It covers all the projects I have completed over the past three years during my engineering studies, with the exception of my Radio Astronomy Project (SIERRA) with Professor Maurizio Burla at TU Berlin this year. If this project interests you, I can, of course, request my professor’s permission to share it. Some of the files are written in French, but each one includes an abstract in English.

In this “Project” folder, you will find:

- A report from my first-year internship at EREMS (EREMS memoir.pdf), as well as an article I published about this experience as part of my involvement with my school’s junior enterprise, ENAC (NewSpace article.pdf).

- A user manual for software I developed during my internship at DLR in Berlin to facilitate the calculation of various optical parameters for a space mission (SNR_Tool.pdf). During this internship, I also conducted an orbitology study for a probe to optimize its mapping of Enceladus' surface.

- A project completed at my school with the telecommunications team, where I worked on indoor user localization based on received Wi-Fi signals, having first mapped these signals within a designated space (Wi_Fi_signal_mapping_project.pdf).

- An early-year internship report from CNRS, where I detail my data analysis work on the Juice probe (CNRS_GOSSIN_report.pdf).

- My final thesis, which is currently in progress. I am collaborating with the Paris Observatory on the development of a photon detector (OBSM_report.pdf).
